# ArcadeRS

A simple old-school shooter made to explore the Rust programming language and ecosystem.
Made following the ArcadeRS tutorial at https://jadpole.github.io/arcaders/arcaders-1-0

Changed the version of the sdl2 dependency to 0.23.0, the latest version, and did the same for the sdl2_image dependency.
Having all sdl2 dependencies on the same version to prevent errors. 

##### TODO/Issues:
* Explosions don't (always) appear at the location of the destroyed asteroid
* Escape key doesn't bring you back to the main menu
